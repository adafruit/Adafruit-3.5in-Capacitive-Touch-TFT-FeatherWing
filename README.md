### Description

Bedeck your Feather project with a beautiful Adafruit TFT FeatherWing, 3.5" 480x320 Capacitive Touchscreen. This TFT display is 3.5" diagonal with a bright white-LED backlight and a built-in microSD card socket. You get a massive 480x320 pixels with individual 16-bit color pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display, and twice as much as our 2.4" TFT FeatherWing. As a bonus, this display comes with a multi-touch capacitive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect up to 5 finger presses anywhere on the screen

This FeatherWing uses a SPI display and SD card socket, with I2C touchscreen. It works with any and all Feather boards but given the large display it works best with our faster boards like the nRF52, RP2040, ESP32, M0 and M4 (basically anything that is > 32 MHz). It includes a capacitive touchscreen controller controlled over I2C so you only need one additional interrupt pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. One more pin is used for an optional SD card that can be used for storing images for display.

This Wing comes fully assembled with dual sockets for your Feather to plug into. You get two sockets per pin, so you can plug in wires if you want to connect to Feather pins. Alternatively, each pin has a large square pad on the PCB for direct soldering.

The TFT display is an HX8357D-chipset compatible, we have both Arduino and CircuitPython libraries for it. And the capacitive touch driver is FT5336, with 5-point multi-touch, with both Arduino and CircuitPython libraries as well.
